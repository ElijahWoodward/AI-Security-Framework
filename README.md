# AI Security & Red Teaming Resources  

Welcome to this repository, which serves as a resource hub for securing and enhancing the security of the AI industry—particularly large language models (LLMs) within organizations.  

## 🚀 Purpose  

As AI technology matures, there will be increasing demands for **validation testing and red teaming of LLMs**. Organizations, insurance companies, and other stakeholders will likely require a **structured security framework** to assess the safety and reliability of LLM deployments—especially for **sovereign LLMs** (privately hosted or customized models).  

This repository provides foundational materials to help organizations kickstart these efforts, including:  

- 📌 A **basic security framework** for LLM risk assessment.  
- 🔍 Resources and guidance for **LLM red teaming** (offensive security testing).  
- 📚 References and tools to support AI security research and development.  

## 📂 Getting Started  

Whether you're working on securing an LLM, performing red teaming exercises, or developing security policies, this repository aims to provide practical resources to help you navigate the evolving landscape of AI security.
